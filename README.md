# *1000

AI agent framework with human-in-the-loop planning and execution.

## Features

- Web interface for agent management
- AI-generated plans with human approval workflow
- Interactive execution monitoring
- Follow-up suggestions for continued assistance
- Unified agent architecture with automatic name/description generation
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- OpenAI integration for intelligent planning and execution

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone and install
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/*1000.git
cd *1000
npm install
```

2. Set up environment
```
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to .env
```

### Run

With Docker (recommended):
```
docker-compose up
# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

This setup includes:
- Hot module reloading - changes to files will update instantly
- API server running on port 3000 (proxied through Vite)
- MySQL database for agent and plan storage

For local development without Docker:
```
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

## How to Use

1. Create an agent by sending a command
2. The system will generate a name, description, and initial plan
3. Review and approve the execution plan
4. Monitor progress and review results
5. Explore follow-up suggestions for continued assistance
6. Each new command may update the agent's name and description to reflect its evolving purpose

## OpenAI Integration

This framework leverages OpenAI's GPT models to:

1. Generate detailed, context-aware execution plans
2. Create appropriate agent names and descriptions
3. Execute plan steps with intelligent reasoning
4. Provide thoughtful follow-up suggestions
5. Adapt to different domains through configurable capabilities

To use your own OpenAI API key:
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React/TypeScript with Vite
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Database: MySQL
- Real-time: Socket.io
- AI: OpenAI API
- Development: Docker with hot reloading

## API Documentation

### Agent Endpoints

- `GET /api/agents` - List all agents
- `POST /api/agents` - Create a new agent with an initial command
  ```json
  {
    "command": "Your initial command here",
    "initialCapabilities": ["Optional", "capabilities", "list"],
    "personalityProfile": "Optional personality description"
  }
  ```
- `GET /api/agents/:id` - Get agent details
- `PUT /api/agents/:id` - Update agent properties
- `DELETE /api/agents/:id` - Delete an agent
- `POST /api/agents/:id/command` - Send a command to an agent
- `GET /api/agents/:id/current-plan` - Get current plan for an agent

### Plan Endpoints

- `GET /api/plans/:planId` - Get plan details
- `POST /api/plans/:planId/approve` - Approve a plan for execution
- `POST /api/plans/:planId/reject` - Reject a plan
- `POST /api/plans/:planId/follow-up` - Generate follow-up suggestions

## Unified Agent Architecture

This project has been updated to use a single unified agent model instead of specialized agent types. This brings several benefits:

### Benefits

- **Simplified Implementation**: A single agent class replaces multiple specialized agent classes
- **Dynamic Capabilities**: Agents adapt to any task by automatically generating plans
- **Self-Descriptive**: LLM-generated agent names and descriptions based on their purpose
- **Evolving Identity**: Agents update their metadata as they take on new tasks
- **Consistent API**: A streamlined interface for creating and interacting with agents

### Migrating from Previous Versions

If you're updating from a previous version that used specialized agent types:

1. Run the database migration script:
   ```
   mysql -u username -p database_name < init-sql/02-unified-agent-migration.sql
   ```

2. Remove the specialized agent files (optional but recommended):
   ```
   ./cleanup-specialized-agents.sh
   ```

3. Update any front-end code that references agent types

The cleanup script removes the obsolete specialized agent implementations that are no longer needed with the unified architecture.

### Implementation Details

- Agent metadata (name/description) is generated by an LLM based on the initial command
- Each new command potentially updates the agent's identity to better reflect its purpose
- The agent's capabilities are configurable and can be expanded over time
- Settings can store configuration parameters that were previously type-specific
